# Project: Small Business CRM & Sales Dashboard
# Context:
# A small sugar-selling company delivers products to local cafés. 
# The owner manages deliveries himself, while workers handle packaging. 
# The company needs a lightweight CRM system with a dashboard, invoice management, 
# and delivery tracking. The app should run locally on web (Streamlit) and use SQLite 
# for data storage. Optional OCR integration will automate invoice entry via camera.

# Requirements:
# 1. Dashboard:
#    - Show global sales overview (total sales, number of invoices, average per client).
#    - Visualize data with charts (bar, line, pie) using Plotly or Matplotlib.
#    - Highlight top clients and monthly trends.

# 2. Client Management:
#    - Add, edit, delete clients (fields: name, café name, address, phone, email).
#    - Associate invoices with clients.
#    - Display client list with search/filter options.

# 3. Invoice Management:
#    - Form to manually add invoices (client, amount, date).
#    - Store invoices in SQLite database.
#    - Display invoices in a table with sorting and filtering.
#    - Track payment status (paid / pending).

# 4. Delivery Management:
#    - Create delivery records linked to invoices.
#    - Fields: delivery date, client, invoice ID, status (pending, delivered).
#    - Show daily delivery schedule for the owner.
#    - Simple interface to update delivery status.

# 5. OCR Integration (optional):
#    - Use Tesseract OCR or OpenCV to capture invoice via camera.
#    - Extract key fields (client, amount, date).
#    - Automatically insert into SQLite database.

# Technical Constraints:
# - Language: Python 3.11
# - Framework: Streamlit for web interface
# - Database: SQLite (local file database.db)
# - Libraries: pandas, plotly/matplotlib, sqlite3/SQLAlchemy, pytesseract (optional OCR)
# - Code must be modular, well-commented, and easy to extend.
# - Keep dependencies lightweight to run on free Replit mode.

# Deliverables:
# - Generate a complete project skeleton with the following files:
#   project/
#   │── app.py              # Main Streamlit app
#   │── db.py               # SQLite connection and schema
#   │── models.py           # Classes for Client, Invoice, Delivery
#   │── dashboard.py        # Functions for charts and analytics
#   │── ocr.py              # OCR integration (optional)
#   │── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
#   │── database.db         # SQLite database file
#
# - Ensure app.py includes navigation between sections:
#   Dashboard | Clients | Invoices | Deliveries | OCR
#
# - Provide sample code snippets for adding clients, invoices, and deliveries.
